# Exploratory_AnalysisPROJECT2

This was a project completed during my Coursera course in Data Science: Foundations of R. The project was focused on taking a dataset such as airpollution nationwide,
being measured by individual sensors. Using the tidyverse package(specifically dplyr) as well as ggplot2, this assignment allowed me to enhance my understanding of visualizing a large data set and interacting with it in a way that produces informative and powerful results. Thank you for reading my work!
