# Exploratory_AnalysisPROJECT2

This was a project completed during my Coursera course in Data Science: Foundations of R. The project was focused on taking a dataset such as airpollution nationwide,
being measured by individual sensors. Using the tidyverse package, as well as ggplot2, this assignment allowed me to enhance my understanding of visualizing data while
working on it. Thank you for reading my work!
